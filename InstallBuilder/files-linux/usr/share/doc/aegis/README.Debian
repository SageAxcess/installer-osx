aegis for Debian
----------------

This is the 4.x Aegis package. The older, database incompatible 3.x
Aegis can be found in the aegis3 packages.

Note that the profile and cshrc scripts that contain the definitions for
the ae* shortform commands are now in /usr/share/aegis/.

aedpager uses 'sensible-pager' as the file viewer.
